# Troubleshooting

Ensure you are working off the [latest release](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit/releases) and/or the latest commit from the main branch.

## Community features are not accessible

Make sure you add `USE_COMMUNITY_FEATURES=True` to your .env file.


##  Multiple errors after running make dev for the first time

Make sure you run the following command before running make dev:

```bash
make migrate
```

## Error using with Codespaces 

When using with codespaces you need to change the location of the backend: 
- Next to the "terminal" tab, go to the "port" tab ([info on ports](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace))
- Go to the port 8000 for the backend
- Right-click and make the port visibility public.
- Then set in the .env file the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOSTNAME value to the forwarded address for port 8000

## Error installing psycopg2

If you see the following error 

```bash
This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but with psycopg2 (2.9.9) not supporting PEP 517 builds. You can verify this by running ‘pip wheel --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 “psycopg2 (==2.9.9)“’.
```

Try changing psycopg2 with psycopg2-binary in pyproject.toml

##  Error: pg_config executable not found.

Make sure that all requirements including postgres are properly installed.

If you're using MacOS, run:
```bash
brew install postgresql
```

For other operating systems, you can check the [postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Error: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

Add `platform: linux/amd64` to docker_compose.yml for example: 

```
  terrarium:
    platform: linux/amd64
    image: ghcr.io/cohere-ai/terrarium:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    expose:
      - '8080'
```

##  Debugging locally

To debug any of the backend logic while the Docker containers are running, you can run:

```bash
make dev
```

This will run the Docker containers with reloading enabled, then in a separate shell window, run:

```bash
make attach
```

This will attach an interactive shell to the backend running, now when your backend code hits any

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

it will allow you to debug.


## Alembic migrations out of sync error:

When developing on the backend if database model changes are made in different git branches your Alembic migrations may diverge.

If you have changes on your branch_a that contains a migration <my_migration_id>.py that is out of sync with the main branch, first downgrade your local branch using:

docker compose run --build backend alembic -c src/backend/alembic.ini downgrade -1
Then delete <my_migration_id>.py for your existing changes, and run:

make migrate
To sync with main, then:

make migration
to regenerate your migrations.
